## Project Overview

Made a project of a single-page web application, built using the Knockout framework, that displays a Google map of an area and various points of interest. Users can search all included landmarks and, when selected, additional information about a landmark is presented from the FourSquare and Wikipedia APIs.

* You have option to see all markers or hide Them.

The app uses a map API provided by Google.
